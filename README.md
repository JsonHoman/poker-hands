# Poker Hands Kata
[Kata Link](https://codingdojo.org/kata/PokerHands/)

### Description:
Project to compare several pairs of poker hands and to indicate which, if either, has a higher rank.

### Note:
I intentionally changed the Kata's Sample Output from `Tie.` to `<Player> & <Player...> tie. - with <Hand Type>: <High Card>`.
This was done to remove ambiguity as to who would split the pot in a tied round.
